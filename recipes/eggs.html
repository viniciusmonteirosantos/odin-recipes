    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In search of tender, fluffy scrambled eggs? Here are the only
        ingredients you need, and the chef-approved method for how to
        make scrambled eggs worthy of any morning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs;
            cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy,
            but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will
            continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
